quick start (try with internal engine first. it’s Passersby from @markeats and it sounds incredible):

- load the script w/ or w/o grid
- choose a scale with enc 1
- use encoders 2 + 3 to choose seed: 36 and rule: 30
- on grid, press random bit 1 and random bit 2 OR use enc 2 + 3 to choose bits (if a bit = 0, no audible note event will occur for that voice)
- use key 3 to move down the onscreen menu (not necessary for grid interaction, but try it out!)
- on grid, press random low and random high OR use enc 2 + 3 to choose low and high bounds for note pool
- use key 3 to move down the onscreen menu (not necessary for grid interaction, but try it out!)
- on grid, press random oct 1 and random oct 2 OR use enc 2 + 3 to choose octaves for each voice/note stream, -3 to 3
- hold key 1 until the sequencer starts
- play around!

the ‘snapshot’ feature is grid-only (for now) and is a way to capture a config you like, up to 8 of 'em. once a snapshot populates, just press it on the grid to jump to it / between 'em. less concepts is at its core a tool for improvisation, so once you have 8 you need to clear them all to get any more. and they don’t persist between loads.

MIDI channels are assignable for voice 1 and voice 2, in the params. you can also transpose + change tempo there to fine tune for different MIDI devices.
